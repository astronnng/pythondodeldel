# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a basic Python learning repository containing simple Python scripts for educational purposes. The repository contains basic Python examples demonstrating:
- Print statements and string formatting
- User input handling
- Basic data type conversions and formatting
- F-string usage with formatting specifiers

## Codebase Structure

The repository has a minimal structure:
- `saida.py` - Main Python script containing basic Python learning examples

## Development Environment

This repository appears to be for Python learning but currently lacks Python installation on the system. The code is written in Portuguese, indicating it's likely a Portuguese-language learning project.

## Common Commands

### Running the Python Script
Since Python is not currently installed on the system, you'll need to install Python first:

```powershell path=null start=null
# Install Python via Windows Store or download from python.org
# Then run the script with:
python saida.py
# or
py saida.py
```

### Basic Development Tasks
```powershell path=null start=null
# Check if Python is installed
python --version

# Run the script
python saida.py

# Check git status
git status

# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update Python examples"
```

## Code Characteristics

- The code is written in Portuguese (comments and variable names)
- Focuses on basic Python concepts like print formatting, input handling
- Uses f-strings with various formatting options (decimal, binary, floating point)
- Interactive script that requests user input for name, age, salary, and nationality

## Notes for Development

- This appears to be a learning/educational repository for basic Python concepts
- The script is interactive and requires user input when run
- Python environment needs to be set up before running any code
- Code demonstrates Portuguese-language programming education
